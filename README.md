Turn the initial 20 lines of imperative code into 7 lines of 2 expressions of declarative code.

Donâ€™t use curly braces {} and IF conditions.

Be purely functional, no imperative code.

Create only unary functions, functions require exactly one argument.

Create pure functions with no external effects, no external data used or modified.

Make the functions composable.

Everything will be clean, loosely coupled and beautiful.

Depending on your personal style, skills and need, stop at a step that best suits you.
If you just want to improve side effects and testability of your code, stop at step 3
